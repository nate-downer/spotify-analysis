This is an exploration of my Spotify Listening Data. The data in this notebook covers my streaming history from 2021/8/5 - 2022/8/4. It was downloaded from Spotify via the service's "Get My Data" feature.

The notebook contains an exploration of listening habits, and song preferences over time. Here is a selection of my favorite plots created in that notebook:
